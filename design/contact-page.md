# Contact / Consultation Page Layout

## Objective
Make it effortless for prospects to book a consultation while providing context on what to expect.

## Hero Panel
* Clean hero with left-aligned heading "Book your Shift Session" and subcopy clarifying agenda (diagnose bottlenecks, align roadmap, next steps).
* Right column features a Calendly embed or form (Elementor Form widget) inside a card with drop shadow.
* Background: soft gradient `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(28,58,95,0.08), rgba(54,179,126,0.16))`.

## Why Talk Section
* Three bullet cards describing benefits of the session (Clarity on priorities, Roadmap within 48 hours, Alignment for stakeholders).
* Use icon list with check icons.

## Preparation Checklist
* Accordion with items "Who should join", "What data to have", "Timeline expectations".

## Contact Details
* Two-column layout: direct email, phone, HQ location with Google Map embed.
* Provide social proof snippet (testimonial quote) adjacent to contact info.

## FAQs
* Use Toggle widget for 4-5 FAQs addressing pricing, engagement length, confidentiality.

## Final CTA
* Banner encouraging visitors to explore resources while waiting for the session.

### Elementor Tips
* Apply `form-card` class to the booking form container for consistent styling.
* Enable multi-step form with progress bar if not embedding Calendly.
* Set success message to include link to a prep PDF.
