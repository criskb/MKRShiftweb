# Services Page Modules

## Hero / Value Proposition
* **Structure:** Full-width hero with midnight navy background and white text. Use two-column Flexbox container (copy left, image/right).
* **Copy Prompt:** "We engineer the operating systems that scaling teams rely on." Follow with two-sentence paragraph and dual CTAs "Explore engagement models" (ghost) + "Talk to an expert" (primary).
* **Visual:** Layered card or workshop photo with gradient overlay to maintain contrast.

## Outcomes Snapshot Bar
* Three stat pills reinforcing measurable impact (e.g., `+28% pipeline velocity`, `40 hrs/week saved`, `3x faster onboarding`).
* Use Counter widgets inside containers with class `stat-pill` (define in CSS if needed) and icons for quick scanning.

## Service Detail Accordion
* Each service pillar (Operating Model Design, Revenue Enablement Systems, Change Adoption & PMO) expands to show challenges solved, approach, and deliverables.
* Use Elementor Toggle widget, assign class `service-accordion` for border-left accent and animated icon swap.

## Engagement Models Comparison
* Three-column comparison layout featuring "Strategy Sprint", "Transformation Partner", and "Embedded PMO".
* Replace pricing with effort indicators (duration, leader involvement, MKR Shift team). Include CTA button per column.
* Add row for "Ideal for" to help prospects self-select.

## Proof of Execution Timeline
* Horizontal timeline (Timeline widget) showing phases Discover → Diagnose → Design → Drive.
* Between nodes insert testimonial snippets using HTML widget styled with `testimonial-card` class.

## Enablement Resources
* Grid of downloadable assets filtered to category "Enablement" using Posts/Loop Grid.
* Each card reuses `resource-card` styling for consistency.

## FAQ
